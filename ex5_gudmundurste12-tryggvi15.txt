There are people, diseases, symptoms, treatments and vaccinations. 
<{Bob} --> patient>.
<{John} --> patient>.
<{Anna} --> patient>.

Symptoms, treatments and vaccinations apply to diseases. 


When somebody exhibits symptoms related to a disease, it increases the likelihood that they have it. 

When somebody has been vaccinated for a disease, they will almost certainly not get it in the future. 

When somebody with a disease is treated for it, they will (probably) no longer have that disease or its symptoms after a while.


You should define actual people, diseases, etc. and not just their categories. 
Create multiple diseases which each have multiple (partially overlapping) symptoms some of
the time (flu doesn’t always cause muscle aches). 
Define actions for NARS to administer treatments and vaccines, and give it the goal of letting nobody have a disease. 
Can you get NARS to start treating sick people and vaccinating non-sick ones?



<{Bob} --> patient>.
<{Bob} --> [soreThroat]>.
<{soreThroat} --> symptom>.
<{throatSickness} --> disease>.
<{soreThroat} --> (/, isSymptom, _, {throatSickness})>.

// if $x is a symptom of disease $y and $z has it, then $z might be sick with disease $y.
<(&&, <$x --> symptom>, <$y --> disease>, <$x --> (/, isSymptom, _, $y)>, <$z --> patient>, <$z --> $x>) ==> <$z --> (/, isSick, _, $y)>>.
